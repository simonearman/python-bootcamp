### [100 Days of Code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu

Welcome to my repository, where I store my pieces of code for the python bootcamp.\
I've used the mentioned bootcamp to learn python, while having some programming experience in other languages.

### Projects per day
* Day 1: [band_name.py](https://github.com/simonearman/python-bootcamp/blob/main/projects/band_name.py) (Strings and console input/output)
* Day 2: [tip_calculator.py](https://github.com/simonearman/python-bootcamp/blob/main/projects/tip_calculator.py) (Math operations and type conversion)
* Day 3: [treasure_island.py](https://github.com/simonearman/python-bootcamp/blob/main/projects/treasure_island.py) (Control flow and logical operators)

The hangman project takes all the previous chapter's knowledge (and some of my own) and combines them into a new game.\
Sadly, my python knowledge does not (yet) extend onto editing the previously printed lines, which is why the program continuously prints everything in new lines, making a slight mess.

The words.txt file has been made by Xethron (and can be modified to include some of your own words into the game)

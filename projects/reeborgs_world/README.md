During the 6th day the main challenge was to lead Reeborg to his destination using in-game functions.

My provided pieces of code are the answers to the following worlds:\
hurdle.py -> [Hurdle 1-4](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?name=Hurdle%204)\
maze.py -> [Maze](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?name=Maze)

Outside the game environment the code will not work.
